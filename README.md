## Project Scope
Our project consisted in developing an AWS-Lex bot that calculates the price for health insurance based on user entry, and offers to complete the purchase transaction payable in ETHER, credit cared, or Paypal.

## Description
    Our team developed an automated end-to-end Health Insurance Sales Bot powered by Lex on AWS. The Bot is capable of asking all socio-demographic and health screening questions used to calculate the price of a Health Plan for the user. 

    Health Plan insurance pricing is based on age, healthy behaviors, as well as discounts if the user meets certain criteria such as WA State Residency or prior military service.  
    
    Once all screening questions are answered the Bot returns the most suitable Health Plan available for the user. The user is taken to a Streamlit page capable of collecing payment in the form of ETHER, Credit Card, or Paypal.

## Research Questions to Answer
1. Authenticating Streamlit from AWS-Lex
2. Capabilities of Streamlit completing the transaction or accepting ETHER payment. 
3. Potential cost savings for insurance companies to support to stream sales, and provide a better customer purchase experience. 

## Datasets to be used
        
        health_plan_offerings.csv

This data set contains pricing for 4 Health Plan Offerings based on a tier systeem
Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum. Each with an initial individual price, that varies based on user data entered, such as age, income, healthy behaviors, etc.
